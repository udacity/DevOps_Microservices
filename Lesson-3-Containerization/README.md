# Data Engineering API Example

An example project that shows how to create a Data Engineering API around Flask and Pandas:

Data teams often need to build libraries and services to make it easier to work with data on the platform.  In this example there is a need to create a Proof of Concept aggregation of csv data.  A REST API that accepts a csv, a column to group on, and a column to aggregate and returns the result.

Note,this project is a Chapter in the book Pragmatic AI, the entire projects source can be found [here](https://github.com/noahgift/pragmaticai)

## Using the default web app.
The Swagger API has some pretty powerful tools built in.

* To list the plugins that are loaded:

* To apply one of those functions:

## Sample Input

```
first_name,last_name,count
chuck,norris,10
kristen,norris,17
john,lee,3
sam,mcgregor,15
john,mcgregor,19
```
## Sample Output

```
norris,27
lee,3
mcgregor,34
```

## How to run example and setup environment:

To create environment (tested on OS X 10.12.5), run `make setup`, which does the following commands below:

```
mkdir -p ~/.pai-aws && python3 -m venv ~/.pai-aws
```

Then source the virtualenv.  Typically I do it this way, I add an alias to my .zshrc:

```
alias ntop="cd ~/src/pai-aws && source ~/.pai-aws/bin/activate"
```

I can then type in:  `ntop` and I cd into my checkout and source a virtualenv.  Next, I then make sure I have the latest packages and that linting and tests pass by running make all:

```make all```


I also like to verify that pylint and pytest and python are exactly the versions I expect, so I added a make command env to conveniently check for these:

```make env

(.pai-aws) ➜  pai-aws git:(master) ✗ make env
#Show information about environment
which python3
/Users/noahgift/.pai-aws/bin/python3
python3 --version
Python 3.6.1
which pytest
/Users/noahgift/.pai-aws/bin/pytest
which pylint
/Users/noahgift/.pai-aws/bin/pylint
```

## How to interact with Commandline tool (Click Framework):


Check Version:

```
(.pai-aws) ➜  pai-aws git:(master) ✗ ./csvutil.py --version
csvutil.py, version 0.1
```

Check Help:

```
(.pai-aws) ➜  pai-aws git:(master) ✗ ./csvutil.py --help   
Usage: csvutil.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  CSV Operations Tool



Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.
```

Aggregate CSV

```
(.pai-aws) ➜  pai-aws git:(master) ✗ ./csvcli.py cvsagg --file ext/input.csv --column last_name
Processing csvfile: ext/input.csv and column name: last_name
{"count":{"mcgregor":34,"lee":3,"norris":27}}
```

Testing a bigger file than the assignment:

```
(.pai-aws) ➜  pai-aws git:(master) ✗ ./csvcli.py cvsagg --file ext/large_input.csv --column last_name 
Processing csvfile: ext/large_input.csv and column name: last_name
{"count":{"mcgregor":34,"lee":3,"norris":27},"random_column":{"mcgregor":57,"lee":61,"norris":100}}
```


## How to run webapp (primary question) and use API

To run the flask api (if you have followed instructions above), you should be able to run the make command `make start-api`.  The output should look like this:

```
(.pai-aws) ➜  pai-aws git:(master) ✗ make start-api
#sets PYTHONPATH to directory above, would do differently in production
cd flask_app && PYTHONPATH=".." python web.py
2017-06-17 16:34:15,049 - __main__ - INFO - START Flask
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5001/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
2017-06-17 16:34:15,473 - __main__ - INFO - START Flask
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 122-568-160
2017-06-17 16:34:43,736 - __main__ - INFO - {'/api/help': 'Print available api routes', '/favicon.ico': 'The Favicon', '/': 'Home Page'}
127.0.0.1 - - [17/Jun/2017 16:34:43] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

## Test Client with Swagger UI

Next, open a web browser to view Swagger API documentation (formatted as HTML):

  http://0.0.0.0:5001/apidocs/#/

For example to see swagger docs/UI for cvs aggregate endpoint go here:

  http://0.0.0.0:5001/apidocs/#!/default/put_api_aggregate

## Interactively Test application in IPython

Using the requests library you can query the api as follows in IPython:

```

In [1]: import requests, base64
In [2]: url = "http://0.0.0.0:5001/api/npsum"
In [3]: payload = {'column':'count', 'group_by':"last_name"}
In [3]: headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
In [3]: with open("ext/input.csv", "rb") as f:
    ...:     data = base64.b64encode(f.read())

In [4]: r = requests.put(url, data=data, params=payload, headers=headers)

In [5]: r.content
Out[5]: b'{"count":{"mcgregor":34,"lee":3,"norris":27}}'

```

## How to simulate Client:
  run the client_simulation script
```
(.pai-aws) ➜  tests git:(inperson-interview) ✗ python client_simulation.py 
status code:  400
response body:  {'column': 'count', 'error_msg': 'Query Parameter column or group_by not set', 'group_by': None}
status code:  200
response body:  {'first_name': {'3': 'john', '10': 'chuck', '15': 'sam', '17': 'kristen', '19': 'john'}, 'last_name': {'3': 'lee', '10': 'norris', '15': 'mcgregor', '17': 'norris', '19': 'mcgregor'}}
```

## How to interact with python library (nlib):

  Typically I use commandline IPython to test libraries that I create.  Here is how to ensure the library is working (should be able to get version number):

```
In [1]: from nlib import csvops

In [2]: df = csvops.ingest_csv("ext/input.csv")
2017-06-17 17:00:33,973 - nlib.csvops - INFO - CSV to DF conversion with CSV File Path ext/input.csv

In [3]: df.head()
Out[3]: 
  first_name last_name  count
0      chuck     norris     10
1    kristen     norris     17
2       john       lee      3
3        sam     mcgregor     15
4       john     mcgregor     19

```




## Benchmark web Service

Finally, the simplest way to test everything is to use the Makefile to start the web service and then benchmark it (which uploads base64 encoded csv):

```

(.pai-aws) ➜  pai-aws git:(master) ✗ make start-api

```

Then run the apache benchmark via Makefile.  The output should look something like this:

```

(.pai-aws) ➜  pai-aws git:(inperson-interview) ✗ make benchmark-web
#very simple benchmark of api
ab -n 1000 -c 100 -T 'application/json' -u ext/input_base64.txt http://0.0.0.0:5001/api/aggregate\?column=count\&group_by=last_name

### Circle CI Configuration

Circle CI is used to build the project.  The configuration file looks like follows:

```
machine:
  python:
    version: 3.6.1

dependencies:
  pre:
    - make install

test:
  pre:
    - make lint-circleci
    - make test-circleci
```

Those make commands being called are below.  They write artifacts to the Circle CI Artifacts Directory:


```
lint-circleci:
